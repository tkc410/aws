Create new VPC and launch Vms to that VPC
1) Set Hostname for agent 
    hostname puppetagent.example.com ===> On agent
2) set /etc/hosts on both master and Agent
    10.0.0.137 puppet.example.com
    10.0.0.45 puppetagent.example.com
3) Install Puppet agent with following commands
    sudo apt-get update -y 
    sudo wget http://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-trusty.deb 
    sudo dpkg -i puppetlabs-release-trusty.deb 
    sudo apt-get update -y 
    sudo apt-get -y install puppet
4) Edit /etc/puppet/puppet.conf file and add the following line in there before [master] 
    server = puppet.example.com
5) By default puppet agent is not configured to start, So, At puppet agent, 
    edit /etc/default/puppet and set start = yes  
6)  At agent node, start the puppet service
        service puppet restart
7) Go to master and edit site.pp file and come back agent and run the following command to see 
    puppet agent --onetime --no-daemonize --verbose
    Above manifest [site.pp], if applied successfully, will create a file at /tmp/sharadfile with file content as “This is first file created by puppet”.

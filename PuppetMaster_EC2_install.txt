Create new VPC and launch Vms to that VPC
1) Set Hostname for both master and agent 
    hostname puppet.example.com  ===>on Master
    hostname puppetagent.example.com ===> On agent
2) set /etc/hosts on both master and Agent
    10.0.0.137 puppet.example.com
    10.0.0.45 puppetagent.example.com
3) Install Puppet master with following commands
    sudo apt-get update -y
    sudo wget http://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppetlabs-release-trusty.deb 
    sudo dpkg -i puppetlabs-release-trusty.deb # sudo apt-get update -y 
    sudo apt-get -y install puppetmaster 
4) Edit /etc/puppet/puppet.conf file and add the following line in there before [master] 
    certname = puppet.example.com
5) Create new file site.pp 
    sudo touch /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp
6) Start the puppet master service
    service puppetmaster restart
7) Install Puppet agent and start [use the PuppetAgent_EC2_install file to install]
8) certification 
    1)If the request is received, we need to sign the request using following command 
    puppet cert list -all
    puppet cert sign puppetagent.example.com
    2)If request is not visible on the master, then go to agent and check all the configurations from the beginning, correct the errors (if any) and then again run following command, # rm -rf /var/lib/puppet/ssl    (This command will delete previously generated requests) # service puppet restart   


9)  After successful signing of request, there should appear a + symbol as shown below. If symbol has not appeared, that means request is not signed yet 
10) After successful completion of master and agent installation, configuration and authentication, it’s time to test the setup by running a small manifest. Steps to test the setup, 1) At master, edit /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp file and copy and paste below code, save and exit. 
        file{‘/tmp/sharadfile': 
                ensure => present, 
                content => “This is first file created by puppet\n” 
            }
